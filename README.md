# Predictive-Analytics-Model
Goal: develop a predictive analysis system that predicts the client profiles who will leave the bank.
Result: 79.43% Decision Tree Model accuracy, subject to improvement via feature engineering.

-This project examines a comprehensive dataset of 10,000 international banking client profiles.
-Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain a better understanding on the client landscape,  revealing actionable insights and concerns that strategically affect the relationships between data points.
-Acquiring a new customer costs 6 to 7 times more than keeping an existing customer. Understanding and analyzing client churn patterns helps banks refocus resources to meet and exceed client expectations, thereby increasing retention ratings and improving profit margins.
-Churn models that predict customer retention rates for future fiscal years, improves the ability to build short/long term strategies, execute initiatives, and improve long term growth and security.
